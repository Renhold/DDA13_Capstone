# Psychiatric Emergencies and the Overdose Epidemic
There is a nationwide epidemic involving a multitude of medications/ substances
intersecting with a vast swath of psychiatric issues. Individuals are suffering and the
burden of resolution is often placed on first responders who lack specific training. I
want to explore these issues from a distinct viewpoint of personal experience.

## General Information
As a former first responder, it is significant to use data to understand public health and
formulate solutions - those findings often dictate public policy decisions.
I want to use my newfound skillset and background to investigate both causation and
potential improvements.

## Data Question
From a statistical standpoint, what is the country facing in terms of the substance and
psychiatric epidemics? Are there any major governmental or organizational
interventions/tactics that have denoted improvement in response to psychiatric or
drug related emergency calls nationwide, and are they possible/in use in Nashville?
